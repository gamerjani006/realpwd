To delete a password, you will have to do it manually. Partly because i'm lazy and it would probably be annoying to delete a password you didn't mean to delete.

Do not delete the "{}" part of database.json or it will break. If you did break it, just add back the "{}".


WARNING: Extended ASCII WILL break as of now.
